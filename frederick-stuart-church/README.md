Frederick Stuart Church was an American artist during the 19th century. He was widely known for his illustrations of fairytales and anthropomorphized animals.

<br>
**The Mermaid (1880)**

Even though it was an etching, there are a few special things about this artwork. The first thing to notice is the mermaid riding the seahorse. It’s an interesting and creative concept of how a mermaid would ride on a seahorse, as if it was similar to riding on a regular horse. You can see how the mermaid wraps its tail with the seahorse’s tail for stability. The title “The Mermaid” is also written in the bottom-left corner of the etching. Noticed how the letters “T”, “R,” and “D” are drawn to match the water ripples.

**Women and Beasts **

Church have done many marvelous paintings with beauty women sitting or interacting with ferocious beasts. Two of his examples are Lady and the Tiger (1900) and Supremacy (1887). In each painting, there’s a woman in a white dress holding flowers. However, what they do to the flowers is different. In the Lady and the Tiger (1900), the woman creates a flower rope and wraps it around the tiger’s neck. In the Supremacy (1887), the woman is holding one flower with a long stem, while resting her arm against the lion’s neck. The two big cats in each painting are looking at the women, but one is sitting down while the other is walking. Both beasts are showing gentleness and compassion to their women.

**Taming of the Beast**

Here presents another painting of a woman and a lion. This time, the woman is playing a harp to "tame" the lion. The painting is in panoramic view so that viewers can see a wide-range of the landscape. 

#Comparing Visuals

<br>
**Lions**
.ve-media wc:Frederick_Stuart_Church,_Idyll,_1886,_NGA_63084.jpg caption="Idyll, 1886". 
As you can see here, Church again drew paintings of women with lions. Although both of them were painted in the year, they show different performances. The TOP etching called *Idyll* shows a woman playing a flute at three lions. These look very calm and permissive. The BOTTOM painting called *Circe* shows woman casting some sort of smoke spell towards the sea. Coming out of the are ghostly ladies dancing and swaying.There are four lions this time, but they're behind the main woman, roaring like they're ready to strike on her command. Church's *Idyll* etching seems to show peace and mercy while his *Circe* painting shows preparation and dominance.

**Daughters of Magic**

On the LEFT side of these two comparsion is called *The Viking's Daughter.* In this mellow yellow painting, the Viking's daughter appears to be walking some kind of beach while holding a golden arrow. There is also a long trail of white birds following her and brushing her hair with their beaks as if she's some kind of a goddess. Meanwhile, there's only one bird on the RIGHT side of the comparsion. This grayish purple painting with a woman and an owl sitting on a white crescent moon together is called *The Witch's Daughter*. It appears that she's asking the owl for an advice or perhaps wisdom, since owls are culturally associated with knowledge and erudition. Even though these paintings are opposites to one another, they show some similarities. Besides their interaction with birds, they wore white silky dresses that wave along with the wind. This could symbolizes their innocence and divinity, since each bird from each painting is showing patience and grace towards the daugthers.

**Bears**

These two paintings of animal are so fond to look at. One on the LEFT side is an etching called *A Compendium of Useless and Interesting Information* , which shows bears sledding as other animals watch them. This was found in *The World's Almanac for 1879*, an almanac that conveys information about subjects from different parts of the world.  Church's other painting on the RIGHT side is called *The Rites of Spring*, which shows a celebration of forest animals along with human girls dancing. I decided to compare these paintings because of Church's sketches of bears. Both paintings has shown how much Church has improved with the bears' body proportions and fur details since *A Compendium of Useless and Interesting Information* etching was made in 1878 and *The Rites of Spring* was made in 1905.

Since many of his works were published for various of commerical companies like the [Harper's Weekly](https://harpers.org) and [Louis Prang & Company](https://prang.com/about/), Art collectors wanted to keep Church's artworks and etchings.
